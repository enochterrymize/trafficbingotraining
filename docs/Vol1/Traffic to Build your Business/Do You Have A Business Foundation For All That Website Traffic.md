# Do You Have A Business Foundation For All That Website Traffic?

When you're getting started with website traffic the first thing you need to make sure of is that you have setup a good business foundation and ensure that business foundation works to do what you want it to do. Now right about now you might be asking yourself what a business foundation is, so let me explain that to you first.

A business foundation is exactly that. It's the foundation of your entire business, and for most online businesses, it will consist of three things:

## 1. A page to build your list 

There are a lot of things you can offer to get people on your email list, but it's absolutely vital that you start building a list. Once you have an email list you can then direct that traffic anywhere you want. To your products, services, affiliate links, or anything else you have that makes you money in your business. The page or pages where you are doing your list building is where 99% of your website traffic generation efforts should go towards. 

## A follow up email sequence 

Once people get on your list you need to have a series of emails that have a goal that you define. Maybe it’s to welcome them and get them to know, like, and trust you so they will buy from you. There are all kinds of different goals you could have, but you need to have a goal for your email sequence and develop it so that everyone who subscribes is taken through that email sequence in the hopes of meeting your goal.

## A content hub – YES!

You need content, but quality wins over quantity. A simple blog will allow you to house your content, and that content can be used in a multitude of ways. List building, selling your products, and services, etc.

Of course, depending on your business model will depend on the other parts of your business. Some of you will have physical products and/or stores. Some of you will have sales pages and other marketing pages that sell your digital products. All of those are things outside of your business foundation, but the three things I mentioned above are vital to almost every single type of online business.

If you don't currently have a business foundation for your online business now is the time to build it. Before you drive any more traffic, get a business foundation setup, and drive all your traffic into the first part of your business foundation which is your lead capture page(s). 

Note: I say pages because most people have multiple lead capture pages. I look at lead capture pages like they're fishing lures. You can use different fishing lures to catch different fish. Just like you can use multiple lead capture pages with different offers to get different people into your business. 

For example, if you offer a checklist for beginners to learn SEO from a lead capture page for your SEO business you could also offer a checklist for advanced SEO tactics. You'd still be building a targeted list of people interested in SEO. 

Now let's switch gears and talk about making sure that your business foundation is ready for website traffic.

The first step here is making sure that your lead capture page(s) work to convert visitors into subscribers. If people are coming to your lead capture page and not getting on your list, then your lead capture page doesn't work and there is no sense in driving traffic to it. You need to make it better and/or hire a professional to help you. 

The second step is to make sure that you have a goal for your email sequence and that the emails are meeting your goals. Are people opening your emails? If not, then you have a problem with your subject lines. Are people reading your emails and clicking on the call to actions in your emails? If not, then you have a problem with your emails. You need to study email marketing and tweak your emails until they are working. Again, you can also hire a professional to help you with this too. 

The last step here is of course your content hub. More often than not this will be a blog. Each piece of content on your blog should have a goal, and there are many goals that you can have. Content can be used to bond with your audience, establish yourself as an authority, sell your products and services, etc. If your content isn't meeting your goals, then you need to evaluate each piece and it's goal and see how you can make it better. I'm going to say this again. You can hire a professional to help you with this too. You can find people who you can convey your goals to and have them create content that will meet those goals. 

As you can see your business foundation has many jobs, and you must ensure that each of the jobs are being done well. If parts of it aren't working for you then no matter how much traffic you drive wont matter. All the traffic in the world wont work if all the parts of your business foundation aren't working properly. 

My advice for those who don't have a business foundation right now is to site down and map one out. What will you use to build your list? What will you do to create an email sequence and what goal will it have? What content can you create to meet the goals you have for your business. There are many resources online that you can use to learn each part of this, but it all starts with a plan. Once you have a business foundation setup, start sending traffic, and that will show you were you have any weaknesses in your foundation, and you can either work to fix them yourself or bring in a professional to help you fix those problem. 

For those of you who do have a business foundation I encourage you to take a look at all the parts of it and see how it's working for you. See what's broke and fix it and/or see what you can make better. 

Once you have a business foundation that works, you can drive all the traffic you want to it, scale your traffic, and meet all of your income goals, but it all starts with developing a good business foundation, and you now know everything you need to do to put that in place, so go get started!
