# 6 Big Website Traffic Tactics Explained 

When it comes to getting website traffic you've got to figure out where your potential audience is and use the right traffic tactics to get in front of them in those places. In this short tutorial I'm going to give you 6 different big traffic strategies that you can try out to see if your potential audience is there for you to get in front of them. I'm going to give you a summary of each of them because these are big traffic strategies. I encourage you to do some research to see exactly what it takes to implement each and decide if they're for your business or not. 

## Website Traffic Strategy #1: Paid Social Media Ads

Social media advertising has become a staple in the website traffic tactics world. Almost everybody is on at least one social media site so the chances of you being able to reach your audience there are high. 

Figure out the best social media sites for your business to advertise on, start with the first one, and see what results you get. I recommend that you thoroughly research the process of advertising on the social media site you want to go with, and then take what you learn, implement it, and see what results that you get.

Once you get one social media site working for you, then you can add more, but make sure you start small and start with only one at a time. You will need an advertising budget to use this tactic, but once you get a good advertising campaign to work for you it can pay you back very well. 

## Website Traffic Strategy #2: Organic Content Marketing With Social Media

Content marketing is where you create content that brings your target audience into your business. You create killer content that they want to consume and then post that content to your social media channels to get them from social media into your business.  

There's quite a few "moving parts" to this, but it's a great strategy that works for most online businesses. Do some research to see what your competition is doing and the results they're getting to gauge if this would be a good tactic for you to implement for your business. If you do all the work yourself, you don't need much of an advertising budget, but there will be a few tools that you'll want to invest in to help you implement this tactic. 

This is a great strategy to start with if you have little to no budget and you're new to getting website traffic.

## Website Traffic Strategy #3: Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

SEO is a tactic that has been around almost as long as the Internet has been around. It's changed so much over the last few decades and it's something that will forever be changing because the search engines are always changing. I also consider this another form of content marketing because it's done with content.

With SEO you do keyword research to find out what your potential audience is searching for and then try to get your website ranked in the search results of the big search engines for those keywords. Now there's a lot more that goes into it, but that's the shortest explanation I can give you. 

While you can do all of your own SEO without an advertising budget, it comes with a sharp learning curve and as I said it's constantly changing. My advice is to search Google for free SEO courses, get a good grasp of how it works, and decide if it's something you want to use. If so you can move forward on your own or hire a professional to help you or even do all of your SEO work for you. 

Website Traffic Strategy #4: Influencer Marketing 

In the last several years we've seen influencers pop up in just about every niche you can think of on just about every topic you can think of. These are generally people on social media who have a big following in a certain niche. You can use these people to advertise your website/product/service or to meet any other goals that have like brand awareness and lead generation.

This tactic is for those who have the money for it and generally for those who have a product or service the influencer can create content for or do a straight endorsement for to their followers. Search out influencer marketplaces to see if there are influencers you can work with and what it will cost you. 

## Website Traffic Strategy #5: Affiliate Program Marketing

If you have a product or a service that you're trying to sell having an affiliate program can be a great option. With an affiliate program you get affiliate marketers to promote your product/service to their audience in exchange for a commission. Depending on your product type will depend on the commission you set. With digital products commissions can be anywhere from 20% all the way to 100% commissions but are generally much less for physical products because of hard costs involved. 

This is another strategy with a lot of "moving parts" and options but can be a great source of traffic because you're dealing with people who have the exact audiences you need to be in front of. I highly recommend you spend some time researching this tactic to get a good idea of how it works and how you can implement it, but in my experience it's one of the best traffic strategies and most profitable that I've ever used. 

## Website Traffic Strategy #6: Media Buying

Media buying is the purchase of advertising from a media company such as a TV station, newspaper, magazine, blog, apps, or website. These are companies that have a lot of traffic to send, and while it's not the easiest traffic tactic out there it can provide you with all the traffic you will ever need. 

There is a lot of preparation and research that goes into this tactic along with the need for a pretty big budget. This should only be used by advanced marketers who know all of their metrics, target audience, and thoroughly understand advertising campaigns. Spend some serious time researching this one before jumping in, but also don't be afraid to try it!

Now as I've said, I've given you a summary of each of these 6 big website traffic tactics. It would take an entire course to fully explain each one, but I encourage you to research each one thoroughly. Take notes as you research and once you're done take a look at your notes and decide what is and isn't for you. Pick the one you want to try first and go start using it.
