# How To Create A Website Traffic Plan For Your Business

Your business is all setup and ready for traffic. You're ready to get to the part where you start getting website traffic and start making sales (or getting subscribers, downloads, etc.). But now you're suffering from paralysis by analysis, and you don't know where to even begin. Does this sound familiar? If so, then is what you need is a website traffic plan that you can follow so you know exactly what to do to drive traffic to your website. In this little tutorial I'm going to show you how to create a website traffic plan for your business, so you can start on driving traffic today!

## Step 1: Establish Your Thing

The first step in creating a website traffic plan is to decide what one thing you will be driving traffic to. Depending on your business you will probably have many "things" you want to get traffic to. Lead capture pages, product pages, content, etc. but you will make yourself crazy trying to drive traffic to everything. So, it's important you create a page that you will drive all your traffic to. Generally, this will be a lead capture page because once you get someone on your email list you can then drive them to any thing else that you want, and you can reach out to them repeatedly.

## Step 2: Decide What Traffic Strategy You Will Try First

Here's a truth that most people won't tell you. Not all traffic is created equally and not every traffic strategy will get you results. It all comes down to testing and tracking. You need to pick one traffic strategy to start with, use it, and track to see if it's working. 

Now a few things on that note… All traffic must be targeted traffic. You need to be driving people who are actually interested in your niche at the very least. Second, to get accurate numbers I recommend at least getting 1000 people in front of your website before deciding to make changes or try a different marketing tactic. You can only get good data when you have good numbers.

If you aren't seeing results from your traffic driving efforts, then "tweak" the page where you're driving traffic to and see if the problem is in what you're putting in front of people. It might be a good idea to pull in a professional at this point so you can get help from someone who know what they are doing. If you still don't get results from that traffic tactic, then it might be time to try a different traffic tactic.

But how do you even decide what traffic strategy to start with? Think of your ideal customer. Do they read blogs? Are they on social media? Do they use search engines to find you? The answers to those questions will help you decide what traffic strategy to start with.

For example, if your ideal customer is on social media then you could either use paid social media ads on the social media networks they use or use organic content marketing and social media marketing together to try to get in front of them. If they are using search engines to find you then using SEO or PPC advertising on the search engines would be good traffic tactics to start with.

You've got to figure out where your potential customers are and use the website traffic strategies associated with those places to get in front of them.

## Step 3: Use What Works

If the first traffic strategy you use works, then congratulations! Now you can take that tactic and scale it to get more traffic. If you cannot scale that traffic tactic to get more traffic, then it's time to do some "traffic stacking" and add another traffic tactic to your marketing.

The best thing to do is find 2-3 traffic tactics that work and use them each and every day. Which leads us to…

Step 4: Every Day Is A Good Day To Drive Traffic

Now everything I've told you so far will take time and effort. You've got to figure out what traffic tactics will work to get you the results that you need. Once you figure out those traffic tactics you've got to use them each and every day.

For example, if you're going to be using content marketing with social media marketing. You need to be creating content, getting it posted with creatives on social media, working on growing your following so more people see your posts, etc. 

I highly recommend that once you have your 2-3 traffic strategies that you know work for you that you then sit down and list out everything you need to do to keep those strategies bringing in the traffic. After you've listed everything pull up Google calendar and start scheduling everything you need to do each day. When you schedule the things you need to do each day of the week you can take a look at your calendar each day and know exactly what you need to accomplish. This is how your traffic plan comes to fruition. And the great thing about doing this with Google calendar is you can slide things around to different days, add things in, take things away and even start hiring people to do certain things for you. This will give you more time to work on other parts of your business or even more time just to enjoy life.

The thing I want to drill into here though is that if there is ever a day that you're not working on getting traffic to your website then that's a day you won't get traffic to your website, and we don't want that, right? So, make sure each and every day you are working on whatever you need to be working on to bring that traffic into your business!

Now that you're armed with this information it's time for you to go and get started. First figure out where your potential audience is, figure out what traffic tactics to use to get in front of them, and then use those tactics each day. Use Google calendar or any other tool you want to use to create a plan and work that plan each and every day. And that's how you create a bullet proof website traffic plan!
