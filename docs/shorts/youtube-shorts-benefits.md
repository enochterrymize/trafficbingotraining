# YouTube Shorts Benefits

You need to understand the benefits of creating YouTube Shorts so that you will remain committed to the platform and create content that is high-quality and engaging. Platforms such as Tik Tok have proven that the short video is very popular and by getting your message across effectively in 15 seconds to 60 seconds you will succeed with YouTube Shorts.

#### The Demand for Short Videos is there

You only have to look at the significant growth of the Tik Tok platform to see that the demand for shorter videos is there. It is no surprise really as most people would prefer to watch a shorter video than a longer one to get the information that they need.

Businesses are now creating engaging short videos that get their message across in under a minute. Modern life is fast-paced and most people are too busy to watch long videos. They prefer to watch a short video on their mobile device or their computer that engages them.

The short video platform market is already booming. Companies like YouTube and Facebook do not invest a lot of money into platforms that they are not confident are going to be a success. The demand for short videos will likely grow even more over the next few years.


#### YouTube Shorts Creators could widen their Reach

The advantage that YouTube has over its competitors is that it is already the largest video platform on the planet by quite a margin. Each day, more than 40 billion visitors from across the world access YouTube.

This means that a business should be able to extend its reach a lot easier with YouTube than with most of the other platforms. If you already have an active YouTube channel with a good subscriber base then it may be easier to grow your subscribers with Shorts. You can also keep your existing subscribers happy with shorter form content.


#### Most Businesses can Leverage YouTube Shorts

Some businesses are leveraging the Tik Tok platform to promote their products and services. But the user base for Tik Tok is fairly young and it prevents a lot of brands from using the platform for marketing. For example, a B2-B business is unlikely to achieve much success marketing on Tik Tok.

YouTube is popular with people of all age groups and backgrounds. It is such a huge platform that there is a video for everyone on it. There are very few businesses (if any) that could not use YouTube to their advantage.

No matter what business you are in you are likely to have more chance of success with YouTube Shorts than you are with niche platforms such as Tik Tok. The YouTube audience is much wider and includes professionals that are looking for products and services in the B2-B market as well as the B2C market.

#### YouTube Shorts is likely to be more Resilient than other Platforms

Tik Tok has been subjected to the threat of censorship many times since it was launched. If you put all of your eggs in the Tik Tok basket then any ban or regulation imposed on the platform could result in serious consequences for your business.

On the other hand, YouTube has been around for many years and is the most successful video platform in the world. It will likely be more resilient to bans and regulations than other platforms will be.


#### YouTube Shorts can provide Long-Term Benefits

When you create and upload a Short to the YouTube platform it will stay there forever. This is very different from Instagram Reels for example, where short video clips disappear after a day. If you have a channel on YouTube with a mixture of Shorts and longer videos then a new person that finds your channel will be able to watch all of your Shorts as they do not disappear.

Being able to watch all of your short videos on YouTube could mean that new channel visitors will be encouraged to watch some of your longer videos as well. A YouTube Short published today can still be working to promote your business for years to come.


#### It is Easy to Create YouTube Shorts

You do not need any expensive equipment or software to create a YouTube Short. Everything can be done quickly using your smartphone using the YouTube app. 

We will explain how to create YouTube Shorts in a later chapter, but the concept is as simple as tapping to start recording a video and tapping again to stop the recording.

There is no need for you to own a computer to create YouTube Shorts. You do not have to be a professional video maker either. It is not necessary to use any complex video editing software to make a YouTube Short. Your smartphone and the YouTube app have all the power that you need to create your short-form videos and upload them to your channel.

#### Monetize using the YouTube Shorts 

With longer videos, you can enable ads to monetize. This is not possible with YouTube Shorts as the videos are too short. This does not mean that you cannot monetize your YouTube Shorts. There is a YouTube Shorts Fund which we mentioned in the last chapter that is rewarding creators for making Shorts.

#### Engage Users more easily

We will explain how to create YouTube Shorts that engage viewers in a later chapter. It is a lot easier to engage your audience with a short video than it is with a longer one. Time is a precious commodity for everyone and your audience will appreciate you providing what they want in a shorter video.

#### More Views and Subscribers

With engaging YouTube Shorts, you are very likely to get more views and more subscribers to your YouTube channel. This is likely to happen in a short time if you create the right YouTube Shorts. YouTube Shorts are becoming more popular each day and a lot of YouTube users are actively searching for these shorter videos.

Another good thing about YouTube Shorts is that people can easily access the videos when they are on the move. It can be difficult to consume the contents of a YouTube video that is a few minutes in length when you are traveling around. A short video of between 15 and 60 seconds is a lot more digestible and you should get more views from mobile users.

In the next chapter, we will discuss how to create engaging YouTube Shortsâ€¦
