# How To Get Started With Using Paid Website Traffic

Paid traffic is hands down the fastest way to get traffic. It's basically like turning on a water faucet. Need traffic? Turn an ad on, and here comes all the traffic. However, there is a lot more that goes into it than just creating any old ad and pushing a few buttons. In this tutorial we're going to cover how you can get started with paid traffic, so you don't walk into it blindly, do all the wrong things, and lose a lot of money!

Let's first talk about how not to lose a bunch of money when getting started. The best advice I can give you is don't advertise something that you haven't tested and that you know works. For example, if you want to advertise a lead capture page. Make sure that it converts visitors into getting on your list. You'll also want to make sure that you have a backend that makes you money. If you're paying for advertising you want to at least recoup your investment, and you do that by making sure that what you have will work and that there are options behind it that make you more than you're spending.

Now, this is just one example. Maybe you're going to use paid advertising for brand awareness. In this case you won't see any immediate return on your investment, and you're going to need some pretty deep pockets for this option. If you're just getting started, I highly recommend you focus your paid advertising efforts on things that can directly make you money. 

Now, the next thing you need to understand is there are many options when it comes to paid traffic. Some of them are:

Search ads - These are ads that you see in search results when you search for something via a search engine.

Paid Social Media Ads - These are ads you see while you're on social media.

Media Buying - This is where you buy advertising from a media company such as a television station, newspaper, magazine, blog or website

Influencer Marketing - There are big influencers in just about every niche and you can sometimes pay them to advertise your product/service/brand for you. 

Display ads - These are ads that appear on various websites around the Internet. 

Instream Ads - These are ads that appear on videos on YouTube

And the list goes on and on, so you need to thoroughly research your options and find which one(s) have access to your target audience. Which one(s) are going to be best for you and what is going to be best for your budget. This will take time to research and figure out, but it's vital to your success with paid advertising.

Nextâ€¦ Once you have something to drive traffic to that you know works, and you've done your research on what type of paid advertising source will work best for you then it's time to roll up your sleeves and put the real work in. You've got to learn how to use the paid advertising source that you've chosen. All the way from creating your ads for advertising and what you are allowed to do and not allowed to do to how to scale your advertising and how to measure results. And of course, everything in between. There is a huge learning curve when it comes to using paid advertising and each source and network is different. So here are a few tips to help you:

Tip 1: Research

Start with your favorite search engine and search everything you can about using the paid advertising source you want to use. I also recommend going to YouTube and searching for everything you can learn there also. As you do your research take notes. I recommend doing this digitally so you can come back and organize them into a step-by-step process. Because paid advertising is exactly that. A step-by-step process.

Another thing you can do to research is to take online courses about the paid advertising source you want to use. Places like Udemy offer courses on just about every paid advertising source available and if you can't find anything there you can always do a search on a search engine for courses too. Go through a few courses and again remember to take notes!

Tip 2: Hire A Professional

Another option here is to simply hire a professional to help you. You can find people and/or agencies that will handle paid advertising for you. All the way from creating your ads to managing them. Now, there is a fee for this type of service. Sometimes it's a percentage of your ad spend and sometimes it's a flat monthly fee. While this is more expensive it could save you money in the long run, and a lot of time. We all know time is worth more than money. You can find these professionals by searching your favorite search engine and also LinkedIn is a great place to find them too. 

Now I've given you a lot of information here and it may seem like paid advertising is just too hard and risky. And while it can be hard at first, just like with anything once you "learn the ropes" it does get much easier. You're going to have to inform yourself and put a lot of time into doing so. Now, the most important thing I've mentioned here is that you come to the table with something to advertise that is a proven winner. That will take away most of your risks right from the beginning.  

As you can see from what we've talked about in this tutorial, paid advertising is so different because you're putting your money on the table. This is why so many people shy away from it. They would rather put a lot of time into other strategies rather than risk losing a lot of money. This is a valid concern, but you're in business to make money and there are always risks. If you have the money to put into paid advertising, it can be a great option and a very profitable one too. Don't be afraid of it! Dive in and get started learning today!
