# Tired of Big Blue?  Need that secret traffic?

 
What I want to talk with you about today is a service that was launched in 2014 and is now getting over 3 million visitors a month.  It’s an email group service called:

groups(dot)io


This place is pretty sweet and is surprisingly still flying under the radar.  Like I said,  more than 3 million visitors a month use this service and…


…over 68% of that traffic is coming from the United States with another 11% coming from the UNited Kingdom and Canada.  People are definitely trafficking this site. 


Communities are here, and wherever people gather, opportunities for traffic and sales exist.


When you think about groups(dot)io, think about it like Facebook groups only with email, which in my mind makes it even more powerful.  


It’s a place where you can create and join groups that build and bring together communities of people who care about specific subjects.


With this platform it is completely free to find and join as many groups as you like.   


To start your own group you can use the “Basic” plan which is free and you can have up to 100 members in the group.  Here’s how I recommend using this platform:


Step 1) Sign up for your free account.  Use an email that you check but don’t consider your MAIN email address.

Step 2) Join several niche related groups (think 5 or 6)

Step 3) Observe the kind of messages people are posting in the email group.  What kind of content are they posting?  Is it informative with pitches?  Is it strictly informative?  Is it mostly hard promo?  What is the feel of that email group?

Step 4) Model your content after what appears to be working well in the group. 

Step 5) Start firing off messages to the group consistently (once a week?) 


Generally when you join a new group on groups(dot)io you will get a welcome message.  For an example here is part of the message you get when joining the podpublishing group on the platform:


“ Hello,

Welcome to the podpublishing@groups(dot)io group at Groups(dot)io, a free, easy-to-use email group service. Please take a moment to review this message. Many of you are probably transitioning from our longstanding pod_publishers group on Yahoo - welcome. We'll soon be shutting the Yahoo group down since Yahoo will do so pretty soon anyhow. 

You can visit your group, start reading messages and posting them here: groups(dot)io/g/podpublishing

The email address for this group is: podpublishing@groups(dot)io. Because our system allows for participants to post via web or email, you can use this email to post new topics.

But most importantly, please add this email address to your safe sender list in your email client’s contacts.

This group is a business and marketing oriented group for print-on-demand and electronic publishers. It is a longstanding group, formerly on Yahoo, in support of publishers that are publishing/selling multiple titles in digital form (print on demand, ebook, audio books, etc).”


The message goes on to talk about subscriber settings and how to unsubscribe from the group and then it tell you:

“If you simply wish to receive and post messages to the group by email then you're all set - no further action on your part is needed.”


The message again goes on but you get the point.


Essentially, it’s basically like getting access to a large email list of people who all care about a particular subject.  In this case it’s Print on Demand Publishing and Digital marketing.


I think that the potential of a site like groups(dot)io is fantastic.  I do not care what your business is, you should be exploring this site to see if you can make it work.  


Email is one of the most powerful weapons you can have in your arsenal for online business, and to be able to get access to a group of likeminded people interested in a targeted subject?  Awesome.

Add the fact that when you post to the group, your message will go to these people individually?  Stellar.  It’s just one of those amazing hidden gems that not a lot of people know about, but the ones that do are really reaping the benefits.


And now…that’s you.


Okay, that’s all I have for today.  Over the last 13 emails we have talked about a lot of different traffic sources, many of them are flying under the radar of the mainstream, and yet get tons of traffic.


I have one more message for you, and a question as well.  It’s an important message, I even have a bonus traffic source for you, so be sure to check back tomorrow for my final message on the subject of traffic driving!


For now though, you already know what I’m going to say!  Get over to groups(dot)io and get signed up!


I’ll see you tomorrow.

EM14 - wrap up email
SUBJECT LINE: Sleeping Dogs…

Sleeping Dogs…

As we come to the end of our email series on little known traffic resources it reminds me of something I wanted to share with you.

Back in 2012,  there was this video game that came out called Sleeping Dogs.   It’s an open world, martial arts action-adventure game that has you playing an undercover cop in Hong Kong taking down the Triad (think hong kong mafia) but anyways…

A friend of mine really got into this game.  He poured hours into it and told me he considered it near perfect.  A special game.  One that you could play several times and still find it enjoyable.

So why am I talking about that?  Who cares about some dumb video game from 2012, right?  Well, be patient and hear me out.


So this game, as good as it was, and as many people who liked it…


Never got a sequel.  Heck they even made a movie based on the game but…


No sequel.


Now you can do research and find multiple reasons why there was no true sequel made for Sleeping Dogs.  But at the end of the day?  I think it was a real missed opportunity from the publisher.


I guess you could say that Sleeping Dogs became a real life sleeping dog.


But why does that matter to you?  I’ll tell you why…


All these traffic sources I gave you in this email series, they too are sleeping dogs.  They are waiting for someone to pick them up and realize their full potential.  To see value where others see nothing.


The fact is someone will.  You know, based on the traffic numbers I gave you that some already are.  The only real question is…


…will it be YOU?  Can you wake up the sleeping dogs of these emails?  Use them to drive tons of traffic to your assets and products?


Well…I don’t see why not!


I’d like to end this series with 2 questions now, and I want you to reply back to this email and let me know what you think.  I truly want to hear from you and your answers will shape my future content.


Which of these traffic sources has you most excited?  

And also…

What would you like to see me write about next in future emails?


Let me know!  And I will see you in the next one!

P.S. About that bonus traffic source…it’s called wattpad(dot)com and it’s an online social reading platform intended for users to read and write original stories.

It gets over 189 million visitors a month, more than 20% of that traffic is coming from America and you can add your content to it similarly to medium or vocal media.  

In that way you can use it to build a following on a specific subject and leverage that audience for traffic.  BOOM! 

Alright, that’s 15 traffic sources that aren’t Facebook or YouTube.  Sleeping Dogs, if you will.  And now it’s all up to you.  What will you do?  

I say, go get it
