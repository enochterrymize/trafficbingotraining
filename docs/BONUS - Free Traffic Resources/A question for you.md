# A question for you…


So over the last several emails we have dove into some little known traffic sources.  And when it comes to free traffic I have found that one of the best things you can do is to stay consistent with your attack.  

Whether that’s publishing consistently, or submitting consistently, it really helps to stay moving…you know…like a SHARK!

Anyways, here is my question for you:

What do you think has been your biggest problem up until now when it comes to succeeding online?  Is it traffic?  Is it content?  Is it time?  Is it something else?


Be sure to reply to this email and let me know.  Your answers will most definitely shape my future content, so reply back and let me know.  I want to hear from you!
