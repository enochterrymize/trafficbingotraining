# Free to ANY willing home…


So the last couple of emails I have been talking with you about sites that really specialize in free classified ads.  It’s a great source of free traffic and I want to continue today with a couple more sources like that but first…


You know all this talk of classified ads has me thinking of one of my favorite classified ads of all time.  It had a cute picture of a beagle on it and went like this:

Headline:  Free To Any Willing Home 

“ My girlfriend does not like my beagle Molly.  SO I have to rehome her.  She is a purebred from a wealthy family and I have had her 4 years.  She likes to play games.  Not totally trained. Has long hair, so she’s a little high maintenance, especially the nails, but she loves having them done.  Stays up all night yapping, but sleeps while I work.  Only eats the best, most expensive food.  Will NEVER greet you at the door after a long day or give you unconditional love when you're down.  Does not bite but she can be mean as hell!

So…anyone interested in my 30 year old, selfish, wicked, golddigging girlfriend?  Come and get her!  Me and my dog want her rehomes ASAP!” 


Ha!  That cracks me up.  Anyways, let me give you two more good traffic sources like this, and listen, that ad up there is funny but it’s kind of a reminder too at how impactful humor can be in an ad.

Anyways…let’s get into it:


One) viesearch(dot)com - Vie Search is a search engine you can use to search the internet, submit your website, or browse. Viesearch is one of the most comprehensive human-edited search engines online.  It’s been around since 2004.

Vie Search gets over 60,000 visitors a month.  Over 17% of that traffic is coming from the United States and its major categories right now include:

●	Other Computers Electronics and Technology
●	Online Marketing
●	Search Engines
●	Public Records and Directories
●	Social Networks and Online Communities

Vie Search is a nice place to submit your website.  Especially if you have just created a free offer and you are trying to get some traffic to it for list building purposes.


Okay what else?  Well our next source of traffic is none other than the little known… 

Two) Curlie(dot)org - Curlie is a comprehensive human-edited directory of the internet founded in 1998. It is constructed and maintained by a passionate, global community of volunteer editors. It was historically known as DMOZ, and before that as the Open Directory Project (ODP).

Curlie gets over 68,000 visitors a month.  17% of those people are coming from the United States.  Curlie is a really good directory to submit your website for a boost in traffic.


Alright that’s two more sources for you to grab some passive and/or semi passive traffic.  I have an important question to ask you in my next message, but I’ll save that.


For now, I just want to remind you to get out there and try some of these traffic sources.  Take that action, to get that reaction!


See you in the next one!
