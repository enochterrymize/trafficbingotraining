170 million visitors a month?

Yes, you heard that right.  The site I want to talk to you about today is a blogging platform called medium(dot)com and Medium gets over 170 million visitors every single month.

You are probably already familiar with this platform but did you know that…

…over 26% of that traffic is coming from the United States?


Now just in case you’re keeping score, that's over 44 million people in the U.S. alone that frequent Medium every single month.

A few really interesting things about this site that you should know, now these are very important so listen up:


First) Medium will pay you for your content, based on how many people read it and like it.

Two) Make no mistake about it, people ARE reading content on this site.  It is alive and well, and you can be a part of that action.

Three)  You can only read 3 articles a month for free on Medium.  With 170 plus million people a month visiting, you can safely assume that there are MANY paid readers on the site.  What that means is that the people who will be reading your content on Medium, are proven to pay for content they find valuable to them on the internet.  They are proven buyers. 

Four) You can link out to anything you want in your articles.  So if you can create impact and develop a readership on Medium, not only will you be getting paid, but more importantly you will start to develop a steady stream of organic free traffic to whatever you want.


So how do you break into a site like medium and start getting traffic?

Well, first let me just say there is a plethora of information online already about people driving traffic with this amazing free blogging platform, however a few points that will really serve you well here:


One) Strong Headlines - Medium is a blogging platform and many of it’s readers actually pay for the content.  They value a great article as much as anyone.  But the first step to getting their attention is a great headline for your article.  

Now there are a lot of free headline generators, checklists, and tools that can help you come up with great headlines out there.  The big thing is to know you need that good headline and to be consciously trying to get it.

Two)  Niche Specific -  Make the conscious decision to be very “niche-centric” with your publishing.  Don’t step outside of your lane.  Don’t get me wrong, you can talk about whatever you want, however make sure every article circles back around to your niche.

If you are in the health and weight loss niche, sure you can talk about a random vacation trip to the Bahamas, or a seemingly arbitrary trip to the grocery store…

…but NEVER forget the golden rule:  It’s not about you.  It’s about them.  IN this case, THEM equals the people in your niche  who you want to pull around you.

So that random vacation trip or that arbitrary grocery store run that you write about?  It needs to have a lesson or a takeaway, that circles things back around to your niche.  Something that your niche market can learn or get from it. 


Three) Publish Consistently -  This one is a constant for almost all forms of free traffic.  If you want to see results you need to publish consistently.  SO put yourself on a schedule.  Publishing daily will produce maximum results, but publishing 3 to 5 times a week is great.


Four) How long should your articles be - Medium’s data scientists found that 7 minutes is the optimal length for a Medium story.  Now that translates to around 1,500 words.  


Now those last two points…


Does that mean that you HAVE to write 3 to 5 times a week on Medium to see success?  No.  But it is the fast track.


Does it mean that every article you write HAS to be 1500 words?  No.  It’s just an average optimal length based on data.

The truth is your articles can be as long or as short as they need to be to create impact.  It’s all about getting attention and making a point that people are interested in on this platform.


If you have thought about medium in the  past but never tried it as a way to drive traffic, OR maybe you have tried it but failed, I urge you to give it another go and see if this one might be right for you and your business.  It’s a huge opportunity.

That’s it for today.    I’ll be back tomorrow with another little known traffic source that you can use, but for now, be sure to get over there to Medium and check it out.
