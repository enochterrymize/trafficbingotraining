# Handwritten and nailed to posts?

Did you know that some of the first ever classified ads were handwritten and nailed to posts?  Lol, it’s true.   It happened back in the 1600’s in England however…

America's very first classified ad appeared in the debut issue of The Boston News-Letter in 1704, and was written by the publisher himself: 

"To all persons who have any houses, lands, tenements, farms, ships, vessels, goods, wares or merchandises to be sold or let, may have the same inserted at a reasonable rate."

It worked.  The next issue, a reader placed an ad for two anvils, and the American classified ad section was born.

To be honest, you can learn alot about our history of the world from studying the last 400 years or so of classified ads.  They’ve been a pretty steady diet of culture.  What we want, what we need, what we lost, what kind of person we wanted to date…


…but I digress.  What the heck does that have to do with online traffic?


Well the fact of the matter is, classified ads have worked for over 400 years and they still work today.  I have two free traffic sources for you today that take advantage of the power of free classified ads here:


One) Freeadstime(dot)org - This is a site where you can post free classified ads.  It is similar to craigslist.  Users can add their ads to house rentals, jobs, pets, services and plenty of other categories.

Free Ads Time gets over 185,000 visitors a month.  While around 50% of that traffic is from India, 14% of that traffic is from the United States.  Now if you are doing the math that’s over 25,000 people from the United States on that site.  The traffic is there.

Top categories on this site include:

●	Other Computers Electronics and Technology
●	Classifieds
●	Social Networks and Online Communities
●	Public records
●	Advertising

But that’s not the only.  Let’s talk about another site that works in a similar way:


Two) findermaster(dot)com - Finder Master is another classifieds website where you can find or post products and services for free.  It covers 100+ countries such as the USA and it supports thousands of cities.

Finder Master consistently gets 50k to 80k visitors a month.  Again the United States is the second biggest source of that traffic with over 17% of visitors hailing from America.

Top categories of interest on the site are currently:

●	Other Computers Electronics and Technology
●	Social Networks and Online Communities
●	Programming and Developer Software
●	Public Records and Directories
●	Classifieds


People tend to overlook classifieds because they have been around for a long time, and we are always on the lookout for the “next best thing” but the fact is, they have been around for a long time because they work.


These two sites get plenty of traffic, and classifieds are proven to work.  Why not test them out for your services, products, sites, or assets?  They are free.
