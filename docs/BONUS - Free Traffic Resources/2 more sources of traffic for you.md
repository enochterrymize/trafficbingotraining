# 2 more sources of traffic for you…


So yesterday, we cracked open the wide world of free classified ads.  It’s a pretty overlooked source of free traffic so I want to dig deeper into that space with you today.


Today I have 2 more sites that allow you to list ads for absolutely no cost.  But more importantly, they are already getting thousands of visitors from their regular users.


One) wallclassifieds(dot)com - Wall Classifieds is a great site that allows you to post your ads at no charge.  That’s simple free advertising.  This is a great place to buy and sell locally and you can expect to find all the common categories.

Wall Classifieds gets over 70,000 visitors a month and over 10% of that traffic is coming from the United States.  That’s 10,000 Americans a month looking around here.

Top categories on this site are currently:

●	Public Records and Directories
●	Other Computers Electronics and Technology
●	Social Networks and Online Communities
●	Advertising
●	Classifieds

Okay, let me tell you about one more today…

Two) giganticlist(dot)com - Gigantic List is another one of those “craigslist” style sites that allows you to post free classified ads.

This website is getting over 72,000 visitors a month.  Over 12% of that traffic is coming from America.  That’s about 8,600 people from the United States alone poking around on this site.

Could they be interested in what you have to say or what you have to offer?  I don’t see why not.  It’s completely free to use this resource.  



With these resources, the beauty of it is threefold:

a)	Minimal time investment.
b)	Zero financial investment
c)	Semi passive traffic strategy


That’s all I got for today.  Remember, while there are no guarantees in the world of free traffic, it is absolutely guaranteed that if you don’t take action on any of these tactics or resources, nothing will happen for you.

No matter what I reveal to you here, action is king.  Always.
