The non-toxic social network…

Did you know that Wikipedia averages 600 new articles a day just on the English Wikipedia site alone?  It’s safe to say that since its launch in January 2001  Wikipedia has really blown up.  


BUT…


It’s not Wikipedia that I want to talk about today.

Today I want to talk to you about the self-proclaimed non-toxic social network, WT(dot)social.


Here’s the thing…


WT Social was created by Jimmy Wales in October of 2019, and the guy knows what he is doing.  He, along with Larry Sanger literally created Wikipedia.  Let that sink in…


So, safe to say he knows a thing or two about building successful websites that get lots of traffic.


WT(dot)Social contains no advertisements, and runs on donations (sounds familiar.) On launch it gained 400,000 registered users by December of 2019.  


Currently it’s getting 105,000 visitors a month and it’s largest user base is in the United States with over 17% of all overall traffic coming from America.
But…


What about you?  How can you use this place for traffic?


Well on WT Social you can post your niche related content like you would a traditional social media network but with WT Social, there are things called SUB Wiki’s which you can post to.  Think of them a little like Subreddits or  Facebook groups.


WT Social actually gives you guidelines on how to promote your content on the site.  They want you to use the site and promote your content, they just don’t want you to spam (and they define what that is.)


The top social media networks directing traffic to WT Social are Reddit, Twitter, and Youtube.

If you are sick of the toxic environment of platforms like Facebook, Tik Tok, Reddit, or Instagram…


If you are tired of these social media sites tracking you everywhere you go like some zoo animal being experimented on or something…


…you might give WT SOcial a try and see if it’s a good fit for you and your business.  Nice site, built by experienced people, with great intentions behind it.

Now tomorrow I’m going to talk about a site that most of you have heard of, but I’m confident that many are probably sleeping on it still.  

We’ll get into that in the next message, but for now be sure to get over there to WT Social and check it out!
